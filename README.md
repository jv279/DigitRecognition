# DigitRecognition
Using the mnist dataset I have created a model that recognizes digits that you draw. Used Tensorflow CV2 and Pygame

After testing each digit 5 times it identified the correct digit 58% of the time. This looks poor until you consider that a random guess will only get it 10% of the time.
I think that there may be an issue with overfitting that I am currently looking into
